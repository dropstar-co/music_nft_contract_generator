# Water & Music NFT Contract Builder

> An interactive educational resource to explain legal concepts in the music industry, and output a sample contract for certain artists to attach to their own work

#### DISCLAIMER: Our intention is to provide a platform for legal information and self-help.

Legal information provided by this service is not a substitute for legal advice from a qualified attorney licensed to practice in an appropriate jurisdiction.

### History
This project came together through the collaboration of multiple individuals in [Water & Music](https://www.waterandmusic.com/) as part of our [Season 1.5 research sprint](https://stream.waterandmusic.com/). As an MVP, the current iteration of the resulting contract is very limited in scope as far as what types of scenarios and artists it covers. How we reached this initial version and what tradeoffs were considered can be found in our write-up: [Structuring the law around Web3 music: A new modular music NFT contract framework](https://www.waterandmusic.com/structuring-law-web3-music-modular-nft-contract-framework/).

### Future plans
We hope to expand this tool to both support more types of artists, more creative uses around art and monitization in web3, and more context in the education points embedded throughout the tool. If you would like to join this project, or provide any feedback, feel free to reach out to us at research@waterandmusic.com

We are particularly keen on getting input from lawyers with international or securities backgrounds.
